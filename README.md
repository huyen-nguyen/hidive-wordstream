# hidive-wordstream

Visualizing the evolution of topics extracted from HIDIVE Lab publication titles over time. Written in vanilla JS and D3.


**Play around at:** https://huyen-nguyen.github.io/hidive-wordstream/

**How it works:**

- The WordStream shows frequent words from the titles, categorized by publication venues.
- The font size of each word reflects its frequency, while the stream height represents the number of publications.
- You can click on any word to track its usage trend over time, which will also filter the underlying data table for more detailed analysis.

**Little nuggets that I like**
- 'Read more' when the author list becomes too long
- Hovering upon legend text for its list of venues
- The background in the header also resembles a stream~~
